Smurf is a command-line interface (CLI) application built using Golang leveraging technology specific SDKs, designed to simplify and automate commands for essential tools like Terraform and Docker. It provides intuitive, unified commands to execute Terraform plans, Docker container management, and other DevOps tasks seamlessly from one interface. Whether you need to spin up environments, manage containers, or apply infrastructure as code, this CLI streamlines multi-tool operations, boosting productivity and reducing context-switching.

## 🧰 Credential Fallback from `smurf.yaml`

Smurf supports **automatic credential fallback**.  
If required credentials (like username or token) are not provided via CLI or environment variables, Smurf will read them directly from your `smurf.yaml` file.

### Example
```yaml
sdkr:
  awsECR: false
  dockerHub: false
  ghcrRepo: false
  dockerfile: ""
  imageName: ""
selm:
  chartName: ""
  deployHelm: true
  fileName: ""
  namespace: ""
  releaseName: ""
  revision: 0
  ```

---

### ☁️ Multicloud Container Registry
Push images to multiple registries from one CLI:
- Supported: **AWS ECR**, **GCP GCR**, **Azure ACR**, **Docker Hub**
- Example:
  ```bash
  smurf sdkr push --help
  ```
